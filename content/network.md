MBON is a global distributed collaborative network committed to address both local priorities and global challenges that strengthens understanding of marine biodiversity data and coordinates monitoring of associated changes over time. Our network integrates various sciences (biology, chemistry, geology, and physics) and themes (ocean, climate, space, data sciences). It encompasses diverse geographies (the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe, the Arctic Ocean, and the Southern Ocean) and different levels of stakeholders (academia, government, industry, NGOs, civil society).
